# 🧮 Experiment – Classes and Objects in C++

## 🎯 Aim
To study and implement the concept of **Classes and Objects in C++** by writing a program that calculates the **volume of a cube** using object-oriented programming principles.

## 📚 Theory

### 🔹 Class
A **class** is a user-defined data type in C++ that groups **data members (variables)** and **member functions (methods)** together.  
It represents a **blueprint** for creating objects.

### 🔹 Object
An **object** is an instance of a class.  
Using objects, we can **store values** in class variables and call **member functions** to perform operations.

👉 **Key Points**:
- A **class** defines the structure.  
- An **object** is created from the class.  
- Data members can be accessed using the `.` (dot operator).  

In this experiment, we define a `Cube` class with members `height`, `width`, and `length`. An object is then created to calculate the cube’s volume.

## 📝 Algorithm

1. Start the program  
2. Define a class `Cube` with data members: `height`, `width`, and `length`  
3. Create an object `c1` of class `Cube` in the `main()` function  
4. Take input from the user for `height`, `width`, and `length` using `cin`  
5. Calculate the volume as:  
   \[
   \text{volume} = height \times width \times length
   \]
6. Display the calculated volume using `cout`  
7. End the program
